**PROBLEM:**

When you Google "causes for global environmental issues”, a few common terms pop up: 

Namely, Food waste
Plastic pollution
Climate change   

When we think about how we can minimize these issues, oftentimes, we jump to the grand solutions, such as ditching fossil fuels, replacement of ICE vehicles, relying on the invention of something incredible like nuclear fusion. But something people don’t often realize is the cumulative impact of small, little actions. Each tiny careless action, for example, littering, leaving the lights on, or wasting food, all with the mindset of “Oh just this little thing won’t make a difference”, all accumulate into something unimaginable. Think about the billions of people in the world. Say each person wastes 100 kg of food each year. That equates to hundreds of billions of kilograms of food wasted each year collectively. This applies to all sorts of things, not just food waste. But, how can we encourage so many to change their habits?

**SOLUTION:**

This is EcoHub. Inspired by Hack Club, we created a prize-incentive-based web app that motivates people to engage in eco-friendly activities through challenges and competition. Combining our passion for environmental incentives, we aim to make sustainability | fun and rewarding activities so people would enjoy forming environmentally friendly habits.
